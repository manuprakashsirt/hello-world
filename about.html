            Education Street has a comprehensive program designed to train students for all the stages of the campus recruitment process done at various colleges including engineering, BSC and other related colleges. The program has different modules for aptitude test, group discussion, and personal interviews. The program is designed to train students in the recruitment process which helps them land a good job in a good company.

The training includes all modules that most of the companies consider for aptitude test i.e Quantitative ability, Verbal, Logical Reasoning. Education Street program makes sure that every module is mastered by the student which leaves them with no option than clearing the aptitude around of the recruitment process. As part of the course, students get practice exercises and test papers for each test module followed by the comprehensive tests on the pattern of the tests conducted by major companies.

To prepare the student for the next stages, i.e Group Discussion (GD) and Personal Interview (PI), a classroom orientation is conducted on basic communication skills, GD and Interview basics,  followed by MOCK GD and Interview. Education Street provides intensive training for Group Discussion and interview by conducting multiple rounds of GD and PI.

Campus placement or campus interview is the program conducted within educational institutes or in a common place to provide jobs to students pursuing or in the stage of completing the program.

The major objective of campus placement is to identify the talented and qualified professionals before they complete their education. This process reduces the time for an industry to pick the candidates according to their need. It is a cumbersome activity and hence majority of the companies find it difficult to trace the right talent. Many students do not understand the importance of placement training that is being imparted, whether it is an aptitude training or soft skills. They show the least interest in this due to various factors viz., projects, assignments or more of activities loaded by the colleges as part of their curriculum thinking that it is not useful. It is the responsibility of the companies training on placement to make the students equipped on all aspects of career development along with creating a very good impact in them which makes them feel every minute they spend in the placement training session is worth being there and will help them in getting placed in their dream companies.
